# JavaApprenticeshipExersizeBook

This reposotory is a culmination of answers from the Java SE Exersises documents given to me for my apprentiship training in Java. 

You can find these questions in the Java_Exercise_Book.docx provided in the repo. Alternitivley you can also see all the questions within the answer files written as comments. This should aid anyone who looks through these files to establish which code relates to which question. This is particually important for the first set of exercises as it is a collection of functions and methods all called within one document as opposed to a controller class calling particular methods for the desired output.

If you have any feedback / questions baised from the code you see, please feel free to send them my way. My email is michaelhillesdon@gmail.com
